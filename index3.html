            <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</p> <h2> was born on 25 December 1876, 11 September 1948 was a barrister,
                 politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League 
                 from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947,
                 and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death.
                Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England.
                 Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics,
                  which eventually replaced his legal practice.
                   Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century.
                    In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu and muslim unity,
                     helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League,
                      in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, 
                    and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
                     subcontinent.
                      In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha,
                       which he regarded as political anarchy.
                
                By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid 
                the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu and Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League,
                 led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. 
                 During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, 
                 and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims.
                  Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the 
                  entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree 
                  instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
                As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies,
                 and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two 
                 states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71
                 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom.
                  He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear
                   Jinnah's name. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum 
                   <span>("Father of the Nation")</span>. His birthday is also observed as a national holiday in the country. 
                   According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.</h2>

            <h3>Miss Fatima Jinnah, younger sister of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was born in 1893. Of his seven brothers and sisters, she was the closest to the Quaid. Jinnah became her guardian upon the death of their father in 1901. Due to her brother’s keen interest, and despite strident family opposition, Miss Fatima received excellent early education. She joined the Bandra Convent in 1902. In 1919 she got admitted to the highly competitive University of Calcutta where she attended the Dr. Ahmad Dental College. After she qualified, Jinnah went along with her idea of opening a dental clinic in Bombay and helped her set it up in 1923.

                Miss Fatima Jinnah initially lived with her brother for about eight years till 1918, when he got married to Rutanbai. Upon Rutanbai’s death in February 1929, Miss Jinnah wound up her clinic, moved into Jinnah’s bungalow, and took charge of his house; thus beginning the life-long companionship that lasted till Jinnah’s death on September 11, 1948.</h3>

            <h4>The Jinnah family was a political family of Pakistan. It has played an important role in the Pakistan Movement for creation of Pakistan, a separate country for Muslims of India.

        <h5>Jinnah's family history is disputed among various sources.[4] Originally from a Khoja background, they moved to Karachi from Kathiawar, Bombay Province in 1875.[7] Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India).[8] Jinnah was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant, and his wife, Mithibai. His family was a member of the Khoja caste, Hindus who had converted to Islam centuries earlier and who were followers of the Aga Khan.[5] Although born to a Khoja (from Khwaja or 'noble') family who were disciples of the Aga Khan, Jinnah moved towards the Sunni sect early in life. There is evidence later, given by his relatives and associates in court, to establish that he was firmly a Sunni Muslim by the end of his life</h5>
